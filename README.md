This repository contains MATLAB code implementing:
* A looming detection (collision threat detection) paradigm (subfolder `paradigm`).
* Analyses of behavioural data recorded from the paradigm, and simultaneously recorded Biosemi EEG data (subfolder `analysis`).

Further details are available in separate `README.md` files in the subfolders, and in the associated paper:
