This repository contains MATLAB code implementing:
* A looming detection (collision threat detection) paradigm (subfolder `paradigm`).
* Analyses of behavioural data recorded from the paradigm, and simultaneously recorded Biosemi EEG data (subfolder `analysis`).

Further details are available in separate `README.md` files in the subfolders, and in the associated paper:

Markkula G, UludaÄŸ Z, Wilkie R M, Billington J. 2020. Accumulation of continuously time-varying sensory evidence constrains neural and behavioral responses in human collision threat detection. *PLoS Computational Biology* 17(7): e1009096. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009096
